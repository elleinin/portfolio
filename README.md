# portfolio

Hi there! I am Ninielle, a web developer and graphic designer, and this is my personal website and portfolio!
I consider this site a child that is growing and one that I am constantly nurturing, but it is still a child and a messy one.
The code may not be clean in its current state, but rest assured, I'll be cleaning it as I go.
