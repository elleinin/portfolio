# portfolio

Hi there! I am Ninielle, a web developer and graphic designer, and this is my personal website and portfolio!
I consider this site a child that is growing and one that I am constantly nurturing, but it is still a child and a messy one.
The code may not be clean in its current state, but rest assured, I'll be cleaning it as I go.

### 2022 / 01 / 27
Happy New Year! It's been a while, and I've learned a lot since I first made this project, so please forgive the messiness \(;v;)/
The site is updated with my current achievements, but I might start over or move my portfolio elsewhere soon. Thanks for taking time to check this bb project out! :)
